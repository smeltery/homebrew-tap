# Homebrew formula for fugue — the canonical template.
#
# On each stable tag, the release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml)
# renders this with the tagged tarball's url/sha256 and pushes it to
# smeltery/homebrew-tap, so `brew install smeltery/tap/fugue` works. The url
# and sha256 below are placeholders the workflow overwrites; `--HEAD` installs
# from main regardless.
